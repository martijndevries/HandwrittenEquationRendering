    ## Some Explanation and Limitations
    - This tool supports most common letters and mathematical operators, including functions like log, lim, or trigonometric functions like sin or cos
    - To increase the chance of the equation being rendered correctly, make sure individual symbols are connected, and that symbols do not touch each other
    - Structures like fractions are recognized and rendered correctly, but fractions within fractions (or eg. fractions in superscripts) will not be properly recognized
